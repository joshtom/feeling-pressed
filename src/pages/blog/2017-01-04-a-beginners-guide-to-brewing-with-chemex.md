![Shepherd](/img/good_shepherd_3.jpg)

A shepherd is he who breeds, nurture, feed, direct and control a sheep or fold of sheep. He is the CPU for the sheep and decides the aftermath of their lives. That is, either to be alive for milking purposes, procreation, sold, or slaughtered for other business reasons. No sheep exist without an owner but there are sheep without Shepherd. Though in contrast, God does not desire that a sheep should exist without a shepherd and that is why Jesus promised in John 14:16 not to leave us without a Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor—Counsellor, Strengthener, Standby (Amplified Version). A shepherd dwells among his sheep to Comfort, Advocate, Intercede, Counsel, Strengthen, and Standby them in all matter just as God Covenanted with Israel to always dwell among them (Exodus 29:45; Zechariah 8:8).

Each Shepherd is, primarily, responsible to his flock; when a Shepherd whistle, his sheep hears, respond and obey his intention for whistling as Jesus, the Greatest Shepherd, affirms in John 10:27. Summarily, when a Shepherd dies, the destiny of his flock is likely to waste. Note that even the most senior apostles (the disciples) that were the first Christian flock dispatched to where fate could lead them when their Shepherd, our Shepherd was taken away from them by those who would crucify Him (Matt. 26:56). Rejoicing enough, our Shepherd rose again and that’s why our faith and destiny is not futile, useless and vain (I Corinthians 15:14).

I heard a story of a woman who a vibrant man of God prayed for to receive fruit of the womb after several years of marriage. After 7 month of pregnancy, the mighty man of God of died. She had miscarriage and was rushed to the hospital immediately she heard the miserable news because she thought her Saviour had died and there was no way she would deliver the baby without the man of God. The blessing of the womb died when her shepherd died!

David was meticulous to choose his own Shepherd: he chose everlasting/immortal God as his Shepherd in Psalm 23:1. No wonder David never lacked any good things of life. His declaration in Psalm 23:1 was written, probably, during the time his Comforter and Counsellor, Ahitophel, disappointed him (Dr. Jack Hyles *The Story Behind The Psalms.*www.fbbc.com/messages). So he understood what could befall a man who makes another man his Shepherd. Meanwhile his consolation words in Psalm 27:10 shows that he, as the baby of Jesse’s house, never enjoyed parent-child benefits so he had learned from childhood that God ALONE is his dependable Shepherd. Will your Shepherd live forever? Beloved, let me jog your memory that Jeremiah 17:5 says, ‘…Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away from the LORD vs6 says he (such sheep) will be like a bush in the wastelands; *he will not see prosperity when it comes* (EXCEPT IF HIS SHEPHERD WANTS HIM TO SEE IT). He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives’ (NIV emphasis mine). With this scripture passage, we see why some Shepherd live in affluence while their fold continue in penury. MAY YOUR EYES BE OPEN TO SEE THE NEED TO CHOOSE JESUS AS YOUR SHEPHERD.

If you have made any man, be it apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor or Bishop, parent your shepherd (no matter how great he might be), go and study how mysterious King Saul’s life became when Prophet Samuel disowned him! I’m in no doubt that you would decide to switch to the Shepherd who does not die. With these verses, we understand what will become of a person whose Shepherd is man that can die without notice. What if your Shepherd dies sooner than you expect? I can’t imagine how the prophet of Baal felt when their Shepherd refused to answer them!

Beloved, I feel pressed to tell you that it is high time you changed your Shepherd from a man (who can die) to the greatest Shepherd who cannot die by focusing on Jesus Christ through consistent study of and meditation in the Word of God. Also, those of you who have installed yourselves in place of Jesus should reflect on what your fold will say about you after you are no more: will they regret meeting you or continue to flourish because they cross your path? Stop being deceitful; redirect the attention of the fold to Jesus by letting them know the truth which will open their understanding to fallibility of man and the assuring reliability of God.

As you have heard this truth, I declare your spiritual, psychological and physical freedom from deceit, den and desire of Belly ministers who parade themselves as God in the name of Jesus Christ. Your eyes, hears and heart of understanding be opened to hearken and accept this gift of liberation in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Stay Pressed and Blessed till Jesus returns. Amen.
